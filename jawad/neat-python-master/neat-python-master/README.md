## STATUS NOTE ##

Due to lack of time on my part, this project is currently in maintenance-only mode.  The forks by [@drallensmith](https://github.com/drallensmith/neat-python) and [@bennr01](https://github.com/bennr01/neat-python) have been extended beyond this implementation a great deal, so those might be better starting points if you need more features than what you see here.

## About ##

NEAT (NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies) is a method developed by Kenneth O. Stanley for evolving arbitrary neural 
networks. This project is a Python implementation of NEAT.  It was forked from the excellent project by @MattKallada, 
and is in the process of being updated to provide more features and a (hopefully) simpler and documented API.

For further information regarding general concepts and theory, please see [Selected Publications](http://www.cs.ucf.edu/~kstanley/#publications) on Stanley's website.

## Getting Started ##

If you want to try neat-python, please check out the repository, start playing with the examples (`examples/xor` is a good place to start) and then try creating your own experiment.

The documentation, which is still a work in progress, is available on [Read The Docs](http://neat-python.readthedocs.io).
